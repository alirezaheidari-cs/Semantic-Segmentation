- Numpy


## Project Description
This project aims to implement a Unet model for semantic segmentation of road scenes from self-driving car cameras. The goal of semantic segmentation is to identify and classify each pixel in an image as belonging to a particular object or region of interest, such as roads, cars, pedestrians, and buildings. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Cityscapes Dataset, which is a large-scale dataset of urban streets scenes with high-quality pixel-level annotations. The dataset contains 5,000 high-resolution images with a resolution of 2048x1024 pixels, with 19 object classes labeled, including roads, cars, pedestrians, buildings, and more.
